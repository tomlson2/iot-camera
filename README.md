# SenseCam

## Overview
This project is a facial recognition security system. It uses an IP camera and OpenCV to detect faces in the camera's field of view. If a face is detected, the camera will pan and tilt to center the face in the frame.

## Setup
1. Install OpenCV
2. Install the SenseCam library
3. Connect the IP camera to your network
4. Update the IP address, username, and password in the `cam.py` file
5. Run `main.py`

## Usage
Once the camera is setup, you can run `main.py` to start the facial recognition system. The camera will then start scanning for faces in the frame and will pan and tilt to center the face in the frame.

## Notes
This project is still a work in progress and may contain bugs. Please report any issues you may find.
